# Upside Scoop - Ice Cream Ordering System

Upside Scoop is a C++ console-based program that simulates an interactive ice cream ordering experience.

The user is guided step-by-step to make a series of selections:
- Start or exit the program
- Choose a flavor (Chocolate, Strawberry, Vanilla)
- Choose a topping (Oreo, KitKat, Marshmallow, or no topping)
- Choose a container (Cup or Cone)
- Choose a size (Small, Regular, Large)

Each selection is validated through input checking to ensure only valid options are accepted. After all choices are made, the system calculates and displays the total price of the ice cream order.

The program is designed for learning and demonstration purposes and includes basic decision-making, input validation, and function usage in C++.

To run the program, compile the source file using any C++ compiler and run the executable. A sample executable is also included in this repository.

This project was created as part of a group assignment for academic purposes.
